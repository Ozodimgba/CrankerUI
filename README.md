# Openbook-V2 Cranker
### When people create new markets, this script gives them the option of cranking their markets at set intervals (could be hard coded or customizable) where people can choose the markets to be cranked and fund it ahead of time. The UI is coming very soon.
- The cranker is in the cranker directory
- To use the cranker input your details in the env file.
- in your terminal input ```export ANCHOR_WALLET="authority.json"```
- You can test the cranker by running the ```npm run crack```(the test keypair is already prefunded with devnet sol)
